The main objective of this project is to create an interactive chat using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The chat allows the user to engage in a conversation with another person selected through a selector.

## Folder structure

The project is organised in three main folders:

- CSS: This folder contains all the CSS files used to style the chat and its elements.

- JS: Here you will find the JavaScript files that control the logic and interaction of the chat. These files are responsible for sending and receiving messages, updating the user interface and managing the selection of people for the conversation.

- Img: This folder stores all the images used in the project, such as user avatars or chat-related icons.


## Main functionalities
The chat developed in this project has the following main functionalities:

1. **User registration and login:** Users can create a chat account via a registration form. In addition, they can log in with their existing credentials. This allows them to have a unique identity in the chat and to access previous conversations.
   
2. **User selection:** By means of a selector, the user can choose with whom he/she wants to start a conversation.

3. **Sending and receiving messages:** Users can send and receive messages in real time. Messages are displayed on the user interface in an orderly and clear manner.

4. **Customised style:** The chat has an attractive and customisable interface thanks to the CSS files included in the project. It is possible to modify the style to adapt it to specific preferences or needs.

## Backend and database

This project uses a backend and a database provided by the teacher. These components are responsible for managing the persistence of messages and ensuring proper communication between users.

The code related to the backend and database is embedded in the corresponding JavaScript files and communicates with the server via API or AJAX calls.
